### Objective  
The objective of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data by addressing data imbalance and leveraging the Random Forest classifier for robust predictions.  

### Key Activities  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Used the `SMOTE` technique to handle class imbalance by oversampling the minority class.  
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.  
- **Model Development**:  
  - Implemented a Random Forest Classifier for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and its robustness to overfitting.  
- **Model Evaluation**:  
  - Used a confusion matrix to evaluate true positives, false positives, and other metrics.  
  - Generated a classification report containing precision, recall, and F1-score.  

### Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data preprocessing and model development.  
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.  
- **scikit-learn**:  
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: Model for binary classification.  
  - **Metrics**: Evaluated performance using confusion matrix and classification report.  
- **imblearn**:  
  - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**: Balanced the dataset by oversampling the minority class.  

### Results  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displayed the performance of the classifier in terms of true positives, false positives, etc.  
- **Classification Report**: Provided detailed metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.  

### Key Insights  
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: SMOTE effectively balanced the dataset, leading to improved model performance.  
- **Model Accuracy**: Random Forest's ensemble approach provided accurate predictions on the test dataset.  
- **Fraud Detection**: Identified fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall, showcasing the model's practical applicability.  

This project demonstrates how to handle imbalanced datasets effectively and build a robust classifier for critical applications like fraud detection.
